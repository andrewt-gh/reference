let person = {
  name: 'Andrew',
  age: 26
};

// Write a console.log() under your person object. Inside of it, use dot notation to print your name to the console.

console.log(person.name);

// Create another console.log() to log your age key from within the person variable.

console.log(person.age);

// Modify the dot notation selector for the name key you wrote in the last exercise to use bracket notation instead.

console.log(person['name']);

// Now, modify the age key to use bracket notation instead of dot notation as well.

console.log(person['age']);
